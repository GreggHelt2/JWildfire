V2.50 R2 (27.05.2015):
 - Added a new option tinaIntegrationChaoticaAnimationExport to the preferences. This option controls if the 
   flames which are exchanged over the Chaotica-bridge are animated flames or static flames.
   In case you export them as static flames and have not a Studio licence for Chaotica you may render in higher resolutions.
   Per default this option is set to off, i.e. exported flames are static.

    - gamma
    - rgb (one curve for each color component)
    - full (three curves for each color component)

 - fixed dark background in the help-section

V1.90 (24.08.2014):
 - Motion-Curves in the Main-Editor:
    - after a long period of development I finally decided to enable the motion-curve-editor in the main editor! This means you can define 
      a motion curve (drawn with you mouse) for each flame-property to create awesome animations, using the most easy-to-use interface possible. 
      You may even add controlled motion-blur! 
      Or you can use this feature to modify different properties at the same time to find "interesting spots". The possibilities are endless :-)
      You will see a new large button to enable/disable this new features. I. E. if you dont care about animations, you will notice no change,
      unless you press this button :-)    
      A video-tutorial on all this stuff will come later...
    - preview-playback-function for the global motioncurve-editing-mode
    - automatically save the flame rendered in the interactive renderer as "jwf_ir_current.flame" (like an auto quicksave). So, in case of a rare crash you will always keep you latest flame in the IR.
      
 - Mesh-Generator:
    - new Option to skip slices in the mesh-generating-process  
    - added some image-pre-filtering-options to modify (smooth) the generated slices 
    - some experimental option to thicken details, may get obsolete by using the pre-filters (requires more testing, any feedback is welcome)
    - Created an official JWildfire-shop at shapeways: https://www.shapeways.com/shops/jwildfire (It is not about making money, just to show what 
      the mesh-generator can do. But you can also buy this stuff, of course, I have tried to make the prices as fair as possible)  
    
 - Other changes:
    - improved the speed and "smoothness" of the interactive renderer
    - extended the "mandelbrot"-variation by three params: "seed" (allowing fixed random shapes which may be better animated), "max_points" (to specify the number of fixed major points which build the shape, good if you plan to increase the surface by using a blur-variation) and "rnd_z_range" (specify a range at the z-direction where the major points get distributed, can lead to much more interesting models)
    - added new shape TRIANGLE and PYRAMID to "primitives_wf"-variation (right, it is now easy to build the pyramids :D)
    - fixed the encoding of the start_mac.command file, thanks again to Matthew Townsend
    - new "sph3D"-variation by Xyrus02
    - added the methode getCurrLayer() to the script-runner-interface
    - some additions to the FAQ-section    
    
V1.80 (10.08.2014):
 - new module to generate meshes from 3d-flame-fractals! The module consists of three parts: 
     - a volumetric renderer
     - a mesh generator which uses the marching-cubes-algorithm to generate a mesh from a stack of rendered images
     - a previewer which can either create a quick-preview by some internal renderer or a high quality-preview by using the integrated sunflow-renderer 
   In comparison to some other solutions the module has the following strengths: 
     - it works multi-threaded and has decent speed
     - it creates not only vertices, but also vertex normals
     - it is able to process really huge meshes, if you have enough memory
     - the mesh-generator supports additional smoothing and can process any image-stack in the formats supported by JWildfire. So probably you could also convert Mandelbulb3D Voxelstack by using this modeule (I have not tried it, so any feedback is welcome) 
     - it is extensible and open source   
 - restructured the Help/About-section, updated some informations, added an Aphophysis-users-hints-page
 - improved the "Strong hue"-random-color-generator to produce more interesting results
 - black-border-fix for the "bwrands"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "log_db"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "asteria"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "ztwister"-variation by dark-beam
 - made the "custom_wf"-variations more robust to errors. If an error occurs during regular calculation (e.g. after loading a flame with errors in the java-code) the variation does nothing. If you edit the code, you cant save it until you fixed the error
 - improved start-script for Macs by Matthew Townsend
 - new fluent-API to create sunflow-scenes (only interesting for developers)

V1.70 (06.07.2014):
 - new tab for local modification of gamma, contrast and saturation on a transform-basis. 
   Those work similiar to the color values ("color" and "color-speed"), but they control changes in applied color values, 
   rather than specifying color values themselfs. This is a true new addition to the Flame Fractal Algorithm itself, 
   and makes it much more easy to create flame fractals with more depth, without the need of endless fiddling with the gradient :-)     
 - new buttoms for randomization and reset of local color effects   
 - new mutation-type "Local gamma" allowing local-gamma-modifications in the MutaGen-module

 - improved "cross"-random-flame-generator, also uses the new "rays"-variations 
 - made the "custom_wf"-variation more robust against compile/syntax errors
 
V1.64 (20.06.2014):
 - improved the precision of the the numberic fields (7 digits after the decimal point are guaranteed in the most cases), which is especially great for gnarls. Thanks for dark-beam for pointing at this old bug! :-)
 - improved the smoothness of modifying parameters by dragging the mouse by about factor 2.5
 - the "Fine"-adjustment is now also taken into account when modifying parameters by dragging the mouse. If the "Fine"-button is enabled all changes have a increased smoothness (precision) by factor 10.      
 - new experimental and super-cool "bwrands"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "loonie2" and "loonie3"-variation by dark-beam
 - new "Rays"-random-flame-generator which uses some of the new featurs to create really cool random flames
 - new "jac_cn", "jac_dn" and "jac_sn"-variations invented by dark-beam
 - increased the size of the weight-field (of a transform)

 - improved the "Simple tiling"-random-flame-generator
 - the "colormap_wf"_variations allow now the use of images-sequences (i. e. animations) as input
 - anti-aliasing in the motion-Curve-Editor
 - some additions to the motion-curve-editing

 - new "Strong hue"-random-gradient-generator
 - new "Smooth"-random-gradient-generator
 - new "Monochrome"-random-gradient-generator

 - new "saturation"-setting under "Coloring" (which affects the saturation of the final image. A saturation of 1.0 is the default value. Lower values decrease saturation, i. E. the fractals appears more "gray", higher values add more levels of "color" )

 - new "color map"-random-flame-generator, using randomly chosen images from your image-collection as color-map (you must specify the base-path in the prefs, but please BEWARE that this path is scanned recursively, so please check if you have any "forbidden" images there). This generator is NOT included in the "All"-random-flame-generator, so it must be selected explicitely

 - new "Move to"/"Copy to"-functions in the flame browser
 - some additional "post_*"-scripts for the Easy Movie Maker

 - controls in the editor have now a shadow the increase the contrast with the background (can be changed in the prefs, see tinaEditorControlsWithShadows)

 - simplified the LogDensityFilter (only internal changes)
 - removed the upper-range-limitation of the "gamma threshold"-parameter

V1.50 (30.03.2014):
 - there were really lots of changes in the Easy Movie Maker:
     - new concept of random-movie-generators (which create both random flames and random motion)
     - new random-movie-generators:
         - "Rotating Mandelbrots"
         - "Transforming Duckies"
         - "Transforming Bubbles"
     - motion blur, which is enabled by default and can even be used to render interesting/"dynamic" still images    
     - new concept of "morph-types", the old behaviour is now called MORPH, and there is now a new morph type called FADE which uses layerz to fade one flame into another
     - added the possibility to replace a movie-part with the current flame in the editor
     - some new simple scripts

 - as Java version 8 will come out soon, the minimum requirements of JWildfire were increased to Java 7, i.e. it is optimized for Java 7 or higher
 - changed the camera handling: in 3d-flames there is now a real 3d camera, in 2d flames there is a 2d-camera. (In previous releases there was a "mixed" mode of 2D camera roll and 3D pith and yaw, as introduced by the famous "3d hack" invented by Zueuk)

 - removed the JWildfireC sub project (will be replaced by some OpenCL-based stuff later)

V1.30 (02.03.2014):
 - New concept of "post-symmetries". A post symmetry is something like a "final transform after a final transform". 
 But unlike to a ordinary final transform it can clone samples and modify those clones, making it very efficient to create fractals with certain symmetry.
 For example, for a mirror-like-symmetry it creates for any input sample one mirrored clone.        
 You also could achieve this by designing the fractal, but using the post-symmetries makes it much more intuitive and faster to render. 
 - New concept of "random-symmetry-generators". Those are a parallel concept to random flame generators and can used in combination. 
  I.E. random-symmetry-generators apply to random-fractal a randomly-chosen-symmetry.
 - Some initial random-symmetry-generators:
    - "XAxis"
    - "YAxis" (not only differing in the axis)
    - "Point"
    - "All (sparse)" (applies symmetry only at a certain probability, this is the default)

The latter points to an arbitrary folder on your harddisc and holds your own scripts. You can easily create and copy scripts either using the new functions in JWildfire or by just copying/creating them manually. Additionally, scripts now always contain of two files: the description (plain text) and the code (Java code)   
 - added most of the recent scripts from the JWildfire Open Group as examples
 - new path for scripts in the Preferences editor, moved the old script path (for the animation editor) into a new "Misc" category

 - updated the link to the new JWildfire Open Group in the welcome-screen

V0.67 (20.03.2013):
 - MutaGen: an amazing new module to interactively create mutations of a certain flame. 
   There are several mutation types affecting different "genes" (types of flame properties). 
   Those mutations are applied at two levels: generation A (8 new fractals from the base flame) and generation B (16 new fractals from generation A), 
   generating total 24 new flames at each mutation step.  
   You can easily exchange fractals between the main editor and the new module at any time. 
   Unlike to many other programs of this type, there is a true history, i.e. you can navigate back to earlier generations at any time. 
   Even if there are so many possible parameter combinations which may lead to singularies and huge computation times, the programm 
   achieves predictable computation times for each whole generation. This is done by delegating the mutation process to separate threads 
   and eventually just killing them.
 - new "sintrange" variaton by Ffey
 - new "Sort" button on the gradient transform tab (to create a new gradient which is sorted by hue and luminance)
